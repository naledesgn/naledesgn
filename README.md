- 👋 Hi, I’m @naledesgn
- 👀 I’m interested in everything design, and recently I’ve been particularly drawn to UI/UX design and how people interact with design solutions!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can about visual communication design, 3D design, and digital effects as part of my BFA program at Northern Kentucky University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that utilize design to improve the world, especially those that focus on human interaction and user experience.
- 📫 How to reach me via email naledesgn@gmail.com or len4@mymail.nku.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m Vietnamese, and that hardworking, never-give-up spirit is what brought me to the US to pursue my design dreams! 🇻🇳
